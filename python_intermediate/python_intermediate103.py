Takeaway From This Project
Using Classes and Objects
We have put all the game-related tasks inside the Game class.

Suppose we want to run our game repeatedly until the user decides to quit it. In such scenarios, we can add code to accomplish those functionalities outside of the class. It's because our Game class should contain code only related to the game.

Exception Handling
If our code may raise an exception, we should put that code inside the try...except statement.

Since our code won't raise any exception, it doesn't matter what input the user enters, so we decided not to use the try...except statement in this project.
