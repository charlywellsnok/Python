Classes and Objects
Create a class

Create a class named Triangle.
Create the __init__() method that takes four arguments self, a, b and c. The a, b and c arguments represent sides of a triangle.
Inside the __init__() method, create three attributes s1, s2 and s3 and assign values a, b and c to the attributes.
Create a method named get_perimeter() to compute perimeter and return it. If you don't know, the perimeter is equal to the sum of the sides.
Outside of the class

Take three integer inputs from the user to represent the sides of a triangle.
Create an object of the Triangle class using the given inputs.
Call the get_perimeter() method using the object and print the perimeter.
For hints, see the code outline.

# Replace ___ with your code

class Triangle:

    # initialize attributes
    def __init__(self, a, b, c):
        self.s1 = a
        self.s2 = b
        self.s3 = c

    # method to compute perimeter
    # Hint: you don't need to pass additional arguments to solve this problem
    def get_perimeter(self):
        perimeter = self.s1 + self.s2 + self.s3
        return perimeter

# take three integer inputs
a = int(input())
b = int(input())
c = int(input())

# create an object of Triangle
t1 = Triangle(a, b, c)

# call the get_perimeter() method using the object
result = t1.get_perimeter()

print(result)
