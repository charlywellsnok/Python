What is a Module?
A module is a file containing a set of functions and statements. It's similar to other Python files that end with the .py file extension.

Create a Custom Module
Let's suppose,

We created a file named test.py and inside this file, we created a function named greet().
This test.py in itself is a module.
Now to import this module from another file, we use the import test statement. Then, to access the greet() function, we use test.greet().
