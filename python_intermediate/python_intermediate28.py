Why classes and objects?
We could have written all the programs in this lesson without using classes and objects. So, you might wonder where to use them.

As we have mentioned before, object-oriented programming is an approach to problem-solving; it's not mandatory to use classes and objects.

So, when should we use classes and objects?

If we are working on a complex problem where variables and functions are related, treating them as a single entity by creating objects makes sense. For example,

Suppose we are working on a racing game.

To solve this problem, we can use objects such as cars, racing tracks, etc. Instead of thinking in terms of individual variables and functions, we start thinking in terms of objects and how one object interacts with the other. This helps us divide a complex problem into smaller sub-problems.

So here's our suggestion. If you are working on a simple problem, do not use object-oriented programming because you have to write a lot of code.

However, if you are working on a complex problem with many related variables and functions, creating objects to solve that problem makes sense.
