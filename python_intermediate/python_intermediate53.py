Why Inheritance?
Inheritance allows us to reuse the same code in the base class. This helps to save time and reduce bugs.

Tip: We should try to reduce the duplicate code as much as possible. If we have duplicate code and need to change something, we need to change it in every duplicate code. This may result in inflexible code and bugs.
When to use inheritance?
If we are working on a large project, it's a good idea to use objects and classes whenever possible.

If two types of objects in a project have is-a relationship, we can use inheritance. For example,

A triangle is a Polygon
A quadrilateral is a Polygon
A student is a Person
