Introduction
We know about computer files. In this lesson, we will learn to perform file operators such as reading content from files and writing content to files.

There are three steps involved in working with files:

Opening a file
Perform file operators (read and write files)
Close the file
Let's cover each of these topics in detail.

By the way, our Python interpreter doesn't support working with files at the moment, so we have to rely on images.
