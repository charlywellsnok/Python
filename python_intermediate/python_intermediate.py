Introduction
In the previous section of this interactive Python course, you learned the building blocks of Python and programming fundamentals.

Here's a quick refresher of the key concepts you've learned so far:

The if...else statement
Loops
User-defined functions
Lists, strings, tuples, and dictionaries
If that doesn't ring a bell, we recommend you revisit the Python Basics Course.

However, if you feel confident in your understanding of the concepts listed above, it's time to understand Python on a deeper level.

In this course, we will mainly focus on two essential pillars of advanced Python:

Writing Pythonic Code
Object-oriented Programming (OOP)
By the end of this course, you'll have a firm grasp on these advanced concepts.

You'll also be able to write code in the field of your choice - whether that is machine learning, web development, automation or something else entirely.

Let's start with writing pythonic code
