Renaming a Directory or a File
We can rename any directory or file using the rename() method of the os module. Its syntax is:

os.rename(old_name, new_name)
Source Code
import os

# rename directory
os.rename('test', 'new')
Here, this code changes the name of the test directory we previously created to new.
