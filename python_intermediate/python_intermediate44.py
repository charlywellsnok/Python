Inheritance in Depth
Now that we know about the basics of inheritance, let's create a more practical example.

Program Description
In this example, we will create a program to calculate the perimeter of different polygons like triangles and quadrilaterals using inheritance.

We will first create a Polygon class that has the __init__() method. Inside this method, we will initialize the sides attribute.
Inside the Polygon class, we will create two more methods: one to calculate perimeter and the other to display the info of the polygon.
Then, we will derive a Triangle class and a Quadrilateral class from it and put methods specific to these classes inside it.
