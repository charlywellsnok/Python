Classes and Objects
There are two steps involved in creating objects:

Define a class
Create objects from the class
Define a Class
To solve the problem mentioned in the last page, we will first define a class named Student.

Class in Python
Figure: The Student Class
This Student class has two variables name and score, and a function check_pass_fail().

One thing to remember about classes is that they cannot store data. We can store data after we create objects from the class

Think of a class as a blueprint of a house. It contains all the details about the floors, doors, windows, etc. Based on these descriptions, we build the house. The actual physical house is the object.

Now, let's see the part of creating objects.

Creating Objects
Once we define a class, we can create as many objects as we want from the class.
