Project Introduction
In this project, we will create a simple game called rock, paper, scissors by creating objects. So be sure to review objects and classes before you proceed.

Working of the game
If you don't know, here's how the game works:

This game is played between two players.
Each player can choose either rock, paper, or scissors.
If both players choose the same thing, it's a draw.
However, if the players choose different things, one will win and the other will lose. The rule is:

rock - scissors: rock will win (rock crushes scissors)
rock - paper: paper will win (paper covers rock)
scissors - paper: scissors win (scissors cut paper)
Project Description
Here's how our project works:

This game will be played between the computer and the user.
The computer will randomly pick either rock, paper or scissors. The user will not know the computer's pick.
The user will be asked to choose either rock, paper or scissors.
We will compare the computer's and the user's picks and decide whether the user won, lost, or drew.
Idea Emoji
Note: We have created this game in the Python Basics course using functions. Now we will create this game using an object-oriented programming approach.
