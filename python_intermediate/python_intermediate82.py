No Need to Remember All these Methods
We worked with many methods of the os module in this lesson. However, you do not need to remember everything.

What to take away from this lesson?

Just remember that we can easily work with files and directories located in any location.

This means we can read, write, remove and rename files located in any location.

Similarly, we can get all subdirectories and files inside a directory, change directory's name and remove directories.

If you know what you can do with directories and files, you can easily search for things on Google.
