Python pip
The pip is a standard package manager that is used to install and manage packages.

When you start working on more advanced projects, we will have to use external packages. For example, if you are working with web development, you will probably use packages like Django or Flask.

To install these packages, we can use pip. Here's how:

To add a package named pandas, a popular package for data analysis, in our project, we can install it using this code in the command line.

pip install pandas
After successfully running this code, we can use the code inside this pandas package.

Note: Our Python interpreter doesn't support using pip at the moment so we cannot test it. When you decide to run Python on your computer, remember that you can use pip to install and manage packages. And, you can always search things on Google if you get stuck.
