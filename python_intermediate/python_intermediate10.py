Creating Objects
Here's how we can create objects of a class.

# create a class
class Student:
    pass

# outside the class
# create objects of Student

student1 = Student()
student2 = Student()
Here, student1 and student2 are objects of the Student class.

Next, we will learn how attributes and methods are used.
