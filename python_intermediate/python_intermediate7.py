Object-oriented Programming (OOP)
In this chapter, we will learn about object-oriented programming (OOP) and how to implement it in our code.

Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a popular technique to solve programming problems by creating objects.

Let's try to understand it with an example.

Suppose we need to store the name and the test score of University students. And, based on the test score, we need to find if a student passed or failed the examination. Then, the structure of our code would look something like this.

Now imagine we have to store the name and the test score of multiple students instead of one student.

If we were to use the same approach, we can use the same check_pass_fail() function, however, we need to create variables to store the name and the score for each student. This would make our code less organized and messy.

Since these data and functions are related, it would be better if we could treat them as a single entity. We can do exactly that by creating objects. This approach to create objects to solve problems is known as object-oriented programming.

Next, we will see how we use objects to solve this problem.
