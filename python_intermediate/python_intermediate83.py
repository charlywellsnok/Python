Introduction
Let's start with what we already know.

We can import modules in our program and use methods and constants inside them. For example,

import math as m

# call sqrt() to get square root
result = m.sqrt(9)
print(f'result = {result}')

# get the pi constant
pi = m.pi
print(f'pi = {pi}')
Output

result = 3.0
pi = 3.141592653589793
Here, we have imported the math module and renamed it as m using this statement:

import math as m
Then, we used the sqrt() method of the math module using m.sqrt(). Similarly, we have used the pi constant of the module using m.pi.

Next, we will learn what a module is.
