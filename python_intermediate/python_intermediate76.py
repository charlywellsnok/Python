Get Current Directory Path
To get the path to the current directory, we use the getcwd() method of the os module. For example,

import os

# print current working directory
print(os.getcwd())
Suppose the location of this Python file containing this code was in C:\Users\lenovo\Desktop\Files\main.py.

In that case, the output of the program will be:

C:\Users\lenovo\Desktop\Files
By the way, getcwd means get current working directory.
