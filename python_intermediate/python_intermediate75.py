Directory Introduction
As we know, a directory (folder) is used to store and organize files and other sub-directories.

In this lesson, we will learn to

Get current directory path
Change path of directory
List all directories and files
Create new directories
Rename directories and files
Delete directories and files
We can perform these tasks fairly easily using the os module.
