Handling Specific Exception
In our previous examples, the same exception block was executed no matter what exceptions were raised.

It's also possible to handle different types of exceptions in different ways. For example,

If the ZeroDivisionError exception is raised, we can run one set of code.
If the IndexError exception is raised, we can run another set of code.
Let's see an example of it next.
