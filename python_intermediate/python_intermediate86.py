Why use Modules?
There are many advantages to creating custom modules. The two most important benefits of using modules are:

To maintain code

Modules help to divide our large project into smaller files. This helps to maintain our code because we can only focus on one file (module) at a time.

Reusability

Once we define a module, we can import and use the same module from different parts of the project.
