Introduction
As we have seen from the last lesson, we can define classes and objects in Python.

One particularly interesting thing about Python is that not only can we create custom objects, but every pre-existing thing available in Python is an object, whether it's strings, lists, numbers or even functions.

In this lesson, we will take a deeper look into this topic: everything is an object in Python, which will help us become a better Python programmer.

So let's get started.
