Introduction
Programming involves creating a set of instructions that tell a computer how to solve a problem.

Because programming is all about logic, we can tackle the same problem in multiple ways.

At times, it becomes essential to find the most efficient method among these approaches. This is where knowledge of Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) comes into play.

Once you've gained a good grasp of DSA, you will be able to write code that is not only functional but also highly efficient and scalable.

By the way, the principles of DSA apply universally across all programming languages.

In this course, we'll explore these fundamental concepts through Python.
