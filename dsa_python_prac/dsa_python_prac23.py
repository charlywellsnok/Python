Sorting is used in:

Data Analysis: To organize and analyze large datasets.
User Interfaces: To display items in systematic order, such as sorting files by name, date, or size.
Database Systems: To order records and perform faster search operations.
Algorithms Design: Some algorithms rely on input data being sorted.
