Data Structures
Let's first briefly understand data structures.

A data structure is a way of storing data in an organized manner so that it can be accessed efficiently. We can classify such structures into two types.

Fundamental Data Structures

We know about lists, dictionaries, sets, etc., in Pythonâ€”they are the built-in data structures of the language. Such data structures are called fundamental data structures.

Each of these data structures operates uniquely, and our choice among them depends on our specific requirements. For instance, it's better to use dictionaries if we need to work with key-value pairs, even though we can perform the same task using a list.

Custom Data Structures

Built-in data structures are not enough for writing complex programs.

Imagine working on a mapping service like Google Maps.

If we rely solely on built-in data structures to create a mapping service, our program won't be efficient.

In such cases, we employ logic to develop custom data structures such as graphs, trees, hash maps, etc.

Note: Custom data structures are developed using fundamental data structures.
This course will cover all the major data structures, including various types of linked lists, heap, trees, and graphs.
