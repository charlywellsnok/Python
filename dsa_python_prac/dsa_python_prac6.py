Takeaway
If we didn't know the formula to find the sum of natural numbers, we wouldn't have been able to solve the problem efficiently.

Does that mean DSA is all about mathematics?

Absolutely not.

We gave this example to emphasize the necessity of optimizing our code, especially for tasks that involve large numbers of calculations.

As you can see, a small change in approach can lead to a significant improvement in efficiency.

Understanding and applying optimization techniques can save a significant amount of computational time and resources. It is an essential skill for any programmer aiming to write scalable and efficient code.

By learning data structures and algorithms, you will acquire the ability to recognize opportunities for optimization and develop skills to implement them in your program.
