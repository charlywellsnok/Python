Different Sorting Algorithms
We will not use the sort() method to sort elements in this chapter. Instead, we will learn about the internal workings of different sorting algorithms.

Each algorithm offers different levels of efficiency, depending on the dataset and its use case.

We will cover the following sorting algorithms in this chapter:

Bubble Sort
Selection Sort
Insertion Sort
Merge Sort
Quick Sort
Counting Sort
The first three sorts in the above list are comparison-based sorting algorithms that work by comparing two elements and swapping them if necessary.

Next, we will learn about bubble sort.
