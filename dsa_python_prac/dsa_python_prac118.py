Traverse Through the Linked List
We will now access each node one by one in a linked list. This is called traversing in programming.

Note: We cannot access elements in a linked list directly using an index, as we would with a Python list. That's why we need to traverse the linked list to access its elements.
Let's traverse through the linked list we created earlier.

How to traverse through a linked list?

We will start our traversal from the head node. Then, we will move toward the next element and repeat this process until the next element points to None.

So, let's learn to traverse linked lists.
