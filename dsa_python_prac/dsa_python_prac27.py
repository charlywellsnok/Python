Working of Bubble Sort
Suppose we need to sort a list of numbers in ascending order.

Unsorted List

Bubble sort works by comparing two adjacent elements and swapping them if needed.

So, we compare and swap all elements with their next element:

Compare Adjacent Elements

After this comparison, the largest element, 16, will be placed at the last position.

Now, we need to repeat this process up to the second-last element so that the second-largest element is placed at the second-last position.

Let's examine that next.
