Introduction to Quick Sort
The quick sort algorithm selects a random element of the list as the pivot and partitions the remaining elements into two sublists: those less than the pivot and those greater than the pivot.

The sublists are then sorted recursively.

Next, we will visualize the working of quick sort using images.
