Introduction
Search algorithms are fundamental techniques in computer science that involve looking for a specific item, value, or piece of information within a dataset.

The concept of computer search parallels tasks we perform daily, such as finding a book in a library, locating a contact in a phone directory, or even searching for a specific word in a document.

Here, we will cover two types of search algorithms:

Linear Search
Binary Search
First, we will learn about the linear search algorithm.
