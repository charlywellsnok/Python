Choosing the Appropriate Sorting Algorithm
Out of all the sorting algorithms we've studied so far, insertion sort, merge sort, and quick sort are the most favored sorting algorithms among programmers.

With this in mind, we have prepared this blog highlighting the general cases where one would fare better than the other.
