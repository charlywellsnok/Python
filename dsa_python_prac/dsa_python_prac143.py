Complexity Analysis of Linked List Operations
The table below summarizes the time complexity of the various linked list operations we've learned so far:

Operation	Time Complexity
Traversal	O(n)
Insertion at Beginning	O(1)
Insertion at Other Positions	O(n)
Insertion Into an Empty Linked List	O(1)
Deletion at Beginning	O(1)
Deletion at Other Positions	O(n)
