Source Code: Traverse Through Linked List
Let's add a method to our LinkedList class that will be used for traversal.

# method to traverse and print a linked list
def traverse_linked_list(self):
    current = self.head
    while current:
        print(f"{current.data}", end="->")
        current = current.next
    print(None)
Output

Original Linked List:
80->9->14->None
