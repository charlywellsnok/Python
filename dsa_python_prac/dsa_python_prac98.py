Introduction
The linear search algorithm is used to find an element within a list.

In this algorithm, we sequentially check each element of the list until the desired element is found.

Suppose we have the following list, and we have to find the index of element 4 (the target value).

In linear search, we sequentially check each index to see if the target value (in this case, element 4) is present. We start from index 0, then index 1, index 2, and so on, until the element is found.

In this particular case, the target value is at index 5. Once this element is found, the linear search ends.
