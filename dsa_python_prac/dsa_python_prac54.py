Working of Insertion Sort
Suppose we need to sort the list below:

Unsorted list
Figure: Unsorted list
To sort this list in ascending order, we follow these steps:

1. Divide the list into sorted and unsorted sublists.

Initially, we assume the first element is sorted (because there is only one element), and the rest of the list is unsorted.

Sorted and Unsorted Sublists

2. Set the first unsorted element as the key element.

Next, we'll compare the key with the sorted sublist.
