#Calculate Fee Discount
#Write a Python program to calculate the fee amount after applying the discount.

#You are a university student, and your tuition fee is $1536.

#The college offers a 10% discount if you pay early.To solve this problem,

#Create a variable named fee and assign 1536 to it.
#Create another variable discount_percent and assign 10 to it.
#Compute the discount by using the formula (discount_percent / 100) * fee and assign it to the discount variable.
#Subtract the discount from the original fee to get the final amount.
#Print the final amount you have to pay.




# Replace ___ with your code below

# Create the fee and discount_percent variables
fee = 1536

# Compute discount and assign it to the discount variable
discount_percent = 10

# Compute and print the fee you have to pay
discount = (discount_percent / 100) * fee
amount = fee - discount
print(amount)
