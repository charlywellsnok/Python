Slice a String
Write a program to slice and concatenate two strings.

Get two string inputs from the user and store them in text1 and text2 respectively.
Create a new string that will contain the first four characters of the text1 string and the last four characters of the text2 string. Store the resultant string in the result variable.
Print the new string.



# Replace ___ with your code below

# get two string inputs
text1 = input()
text2 = input()

# create the result string
# hint: use slicing
result = text1[0:4] + text2 [-4:]

# print the result
print(result)
