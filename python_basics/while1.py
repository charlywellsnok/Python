# count starts at 1, to keep increasing count we decided to add 1 to it ie. count = count + 1


count = 1

while count <= 3:
    print("I am inside a loop.")
    print("Looping is interesting.")

    # Increase count by 1 in each iteration

    count = count + 1


# Code outside of the loop
print("OUTSIDE THE LOOP")
