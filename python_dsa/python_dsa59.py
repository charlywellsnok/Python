How do Divide-And-Conquer Algorithms Work?
The divide-and-conquer approach involves three main steps:

Divide: Divide the given problem into smaller subproblems (mostly using recursion).
Conquer: Solve the smaller subproblems recursively. If the subproblem is small enough, solve it directly using a base case.
Combine: Combine the solutions of the subproblems that are part of the recursive process to solve the actual problem.
Next, we will learn how divide-and-conquer is used in merge sort with the help of images.
