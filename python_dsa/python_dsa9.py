List Slicing
Create a program to print a portion of the given list.

Suppose we have a list as follows:

animals = ['dog', 'cat', 'guinea pig', 'rat']
Use list slicing to extract the elements cat and guinea pig into a new list. Then, print the new list.

Example
Expected Output

['cat', 'guinea pig']



# Replace ___ with your code

animals = ['dog', 'cat', 'guinea pig', 'rat']

# extract elements using list slicing
new_animals = animals[1: 3]

# print the new list
print(new_animals)
