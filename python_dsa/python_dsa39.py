Working of Selection Sort
Suppose we have the following unsorted list.

Unsorted List
Figure: Unsorted List
To sort this list, we follow these steps:

1. Find the smallest element and swap it with the first element in the list.

Swap Smallest Element and First Element

At this point, the correct element is placed at the first position. However, the portion of the list from the second position to the last remains unsorted.

2. Find the smallest element in the unsorted portion of the list and swap it with the second element.

3. Continue this process until all the elements are sorted.

The image below shows the final step in this process.

In the last step, the last two elements may be unsorted. Once the elements are swapped (if necessary), the list will be sorted.
