An algorithm is a step-by-step process to solve a problem.

For example, here is an algorithm to check whether a given number is odd or even.

Step 1: Input: A number n
Step 2: If n is perfectly divisible by 2, 
         - Then print "The number is even" 
Step 3: Else
         - Print "The number is odd"
Step 4: End
If we implement this process, we will be able to write a program easily to check whether a number is even or odd.

n = 5

if n % 2 == 0:
    print("The number is even")
else:
    print("The number is odd")
This course will cover many commonly used algorithms, including various searching, sorting, pathfinding, and traversal algorithms.
