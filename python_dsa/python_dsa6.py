Python Lists
Although we covered lists in our Python course, we will explore more Python operations and methods in this lesson.

This is because many data structures and algorithms make use of Python lists.

We assume that you already know how to create a list, access its elements one by one using a for loop, and access elements using an index (including negative indexing).

Now, we'll learn about list slicing in detail, and then we will cover commonly used list methods.
