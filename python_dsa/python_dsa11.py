List Slicing
Create a program to print a portion of a list from the given list.

Suppose we have a list as follows:

animals = ['dog', 'cat', 'guinea pig', 'rat']
Use list slicing to extract the elements 'guinea pig' and 'rat' into a new list. Then, print the new list.

Tip: You can omit the end index in this case.

Example
Expected Output

['guinea pig', 'rat']



# Replace ___ with your code

animals = ['dog', 'cat', 'guinea pig', 'rat']

# extract elements using list slicing
new_animals = animals[2: ]

# print the new list
print(new_animals)
