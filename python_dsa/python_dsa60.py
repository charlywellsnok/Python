Working of Merge Sort
Suppose we have the following unsorted list.

This is how the merge sort works.

1. Divide the list into two halves.

Note: In the case of a list with an odd number of elements, the lengths of two halves will differ by 1.
2. Continue dividing each half recursively until we get individual elements.

3. Merge the individual elements in a sorted manner.

Here, the conquer and combine steps go side by side.
