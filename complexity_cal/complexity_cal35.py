Big O Interpretation
The Big O notation represents the upper bound of the running time of an algorithm.

Let's visualize it using a graph with input size (n) on the x-axis and the time complexity (steps or operations) on the y-axis.

Here, f(n) is the graph of our function.

Now, we will plot another function in the same graph, c * g(n) that will intersect f(n) at the

Here,

c is a positive constant
Beyond the

  point, the function f(n) will always be equal to or below the function c*g(n)
In this case, the f(n) function will never exceed c*g(n) no matter how large the input gets. In other words, c * g(n) is the upper bound of the function f(n).

What may be the point of learning the mathematical interpretation while we are learning Computer Science here?

We will address this later in the lesson and provide a clear understanding of the mathematical interpretation of Big O notation in terms of time complexity.

For now, let's complete the mathematical interpretation first.
