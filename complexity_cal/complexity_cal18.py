Introduction to Quadratic Time Complexity
An algorithm exhibits quadratic time complexity when its execution time grows proportionally to the square of the input size.

This means that if the input size increases, the time required to execute the program increases quadratically, which is a much faster rate compared to what you see in the case of a linear increase.

If you were to plot this relationship on a graph, it would form a curved line that gets steeper as it goes â€” showing that the time increases rapidly as the input grows, following a squared pattern.
