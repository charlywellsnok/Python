Best Case
If the target is present in the middle of the array, then we will find the target in the very first iteration, making it the best case scenario.

Hence,

Time complexity = O(1)
Meaning, the time complexity to find the target value always remains constant regardless of the size of the array.

We can use any asymptotic notation to represent the best case.

O(1)
Ω(1)
Θ(1)
