Understanding Asymptotic Notations
Asymptotic notations are mathematical notations used to describe the time complexity and efficiency of an algorithm.

We have already briefly discussed the Big Oh notation (Big O). Now, let's learn about all the commonly used notations to describe time complexity.

There are mainly three asymptotic notations:

Big Oh notation (O): upper bound
Omega notation (Ω): lower bound
Theta notation (ፀ): exact bound
Among these three, Big O and Theta notations are particularly the most useful while analyzing algorithms.

As we learn about the notations in the next pages, we will also touch upon their computer science and mathematical meanings.
