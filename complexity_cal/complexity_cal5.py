Choosing Analysis for Time Complexity
As we saw in the search problem we just dealt with, the element we are looking for could be in the first position, the last position, or somewhere in between.

Typically, since we don't know where our element might be, the best practice for calculating time complexity is to use the worst-case analysis.

Important: Average-case analysis is not always feasible for all algorithms. In many cases, the average case is similar to the worst-case analysis.
