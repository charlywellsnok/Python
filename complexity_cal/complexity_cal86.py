Recap: Space Complexity
Space complexity measures how much extra memory an algorithm needs to run in relation to the size of its input.

The most common types of space complexity include:

O(1) – Constant space: memory usage doesn't grow with input size.

O(n) – Linear space: memory grows in direct proportion to the input.

O

O(n

 ) – Quadratic space: memory usage increases with the square of the input size, often seen in nested structures.

We express space complexity using Big O notation, focusing on the most significant term and ignoring constants.

Now that we understand how space usage works, it's time to see how it balances against time — and when one should be prioritized over the other.
