Best Case
In the best-case scenario, the target value is present at the beginning of the array and found during the first iteration of the loop. The algorithm may contain n elements, but the target value will always be the first element.

Therefore, in the best case scenario, the minimum number of operations (1) will suffice regardless of the size of the array.

Hence,

Time complexity = O(1)
This means the time complexity to find the target value always remains constant regardless of the size of the array.

We can use any asymptotic notation to represent the best case.

O(1)
Ω(1)
Θ(1)
