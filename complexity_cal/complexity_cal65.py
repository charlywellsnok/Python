Introduction to Master Theorem
The master theorem is used to find the time complexity of recursive functions.

If you aren't exactly familiar with recursive functions, we recommend you take the Python Recursion course before you proceed.

We can use the master theorem for primarily two types of recursive functions:

Dividing Function
Decreasing Function
