Visualizing Omega Ω with Graphs
On the same graph of the functions f(n) and c * g(n) we created on the previous page,

these conditions are met:

1. 
f
(
n
)
≥
c
∗
g
(
n
)
f(n)≥c∗g(n)

2.
n
0
>
1
n 
0
​
 >1 and 
n
≥
n
0
n≥n 
0
​
 

3. c > 0

Then, we can say that:

f(n) = Ω(g(n)) (read as f(n) is Omega of g(n))
Let's visualize where these conditions are met in the graph above.

Here, the growth of c * g(n) is always slower than Ω(g(n)) as illustrated in the highlighted part of the image.

Here, c * g(n) is called the lower bound because for all values of n in the highlighted part, the value of c * g(n) is always equal to or less than Ω(g(n)).
