Introduction to Logarithms
Before learning about logarithmic time complexity, let's understand logarithms (log) first.

Example 1

What does 
log
⁡
4
(
64
)
log 
4
​
 (64) mean?

It indicates the number of times we can divide 64 by 4.

64
4
3
=
1
4 
3
 
64
​
 =1

Since we can divide 64 by 4 three times, 
log
⁡
4
(
64
)
log 
4
​
 (64) is 3.

Example 2

What does 
log
⁡
2
(
16
)
log 
2
​
 (16) mean?

It indicates the number of times we can divide 16 by 2.

16
2
4
=
1
2 
4
 
16
​
 =1

Since we can divide 16 by 2 four times, 
log
⁡
2
(
16
)
log 
2
​
 (16) is 4.

Logarithm: The Inverse of an Exponential

Always keep in mind that a logarithm is the opposite (inverse) of an exponential function. Remembering this will help you simplify many operations, especially when analyzing algorithms for time complexity.
