More on Quadratic Time Complexity
Algorithms with quadratic time complexity take significantly greater amount of time to run, especially as the input size grows. For example:

Input Size	Steps Required
10	100
100	10000
1000	1000000
As you can see, even a small increase in the input size leads to a dramatic increase in the number of operations.

This is why quadratic time complexity is usually avoided for large inputs, as it can significantly slow down the execution of your program.
