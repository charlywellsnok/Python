Time Complexity Vs. Space Complexity
Many times while coding, you will run into instances where you will have to choose between optimizing time or space.

This is because memory is more affordable nowadays, and time is often a more critical factor.

Hence, in most cases we prioritize time complexity.

Space complexity comes into play only when we are working with devices with very limited memory like phones.
