Degree of a Polynomial
The degree of a polynomial equation is its largest exponent. For example, consider this polynomial:

f(n) = 2n + 2
Here, this polynomial has two terms: 2n and 2.

To identify the degree of this polynomial, we can rewrite it as

f
(
n
)
=
2
n
1
+
2
n
0
f(n)=2n 
1
 +2n 
0
 
As you can see, the largest exponent in the polynomial is 1. Thus, the degree of this polynomial is 1.

Let's take another example:

f

 +10n
In this case, the largest exponent is 3. Therefore, the degree of the polynomial is 3.
