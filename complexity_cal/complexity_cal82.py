Introduction
So far, we have focussed on time complexity â€“ how many operations a program performs.

Now, let's turn our attention to space complexity, which is about the amount of memory that a program takes to run respective to the size of the input.

In this chapter, we will learn about the most common space complexities:

O(n) - linear space complexity
O
(
n
2
)
O(n 
2
 ) - quadratic space complexity
O(1) - constant space complexity
