Introduction to Omega Notation
In this chapter, we will learn what Omega notation means mathematically.

The Omega notation represents the lower bound of the running time of an algorithm.

Let's understand the meaning of the statement with the help of a graph first.

Graph of function
Figure: Graph of function
Here, the function f(n) is represented on the graph.

Next, on the same graph, we will plot another function c * g(n), that will intersect f(n) at the 
n
0
n 
0
​
  point.

Here,

c is a positive constant
the function f(n) will always be equal to or above the function c * g(n) after the 
n
0
n 
0
​
  point
In this case, c * g(n) is called the lower bound of f(n) because the c * g(n)) function will never grow faster than f(n).
