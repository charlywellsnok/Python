Introduction to Linear Search
The linear search algorithm is used to find the index of an element within a list/array.

In this algorithm, we sequentially check each element in the array until the desired element is found.

Suppose we have the following array.

Now, suppose we want to find the index of element 8 (target value) in the array.

Using linear search, we start at index 0 and check each element in order â€“ index 0, index 1, index 2, and so on, until we find the target value (element 8) is found.

In this particular case, the target value is at index 5. When this element is found, the linear search terminates.

Let us consider another scenario where we want to search for element 20 in the same array.

In this case, the linear search algorithm iterates through each element of the array one at a time. Since this element is not in the array, the algorithm terminates once it reaches the end of the array.
