Logarithmic Time Complexity
An algorithm has logarithmic time complexity if its execution time grows proportionally to the logarithm of the input size, usually base 2.

So, why is Logarithmic Time Complexity significant?

In an algorithm with logarithmic complexity, as the input size increases, the number of steps required to complete the program grows very slowly.

Input: n	Steps: log(n)
16	4
128	7
32768	15
This slow growth makes logarithmic time complexity much more efficient than linear or quadratic complexities, especially for large inputs. We will explore this further later in the lesson.

If you were to plot this relationship on a graph, it would form a curve that rises quickly at first but then levels off â€” showing that the time increases slowly, even as the input grows larger.
